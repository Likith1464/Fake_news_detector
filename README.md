📰 Fake News Detection System
An AI-powered web application to identify misinformation and fake news articles using machine learning models and a modern, responsive UI. Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, the system analyzes news articles and provides a confidence score indicating whether the content is likely to be real or fake.


🚀 Features

* Multiple Analysis Models

* Advanced Text Processing

* Confidence Scoring

* Responsive & Modern UI

* Sample Data Loading


🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome

Scripting: JavaScript (Vanilla)

Styling: Gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism, custom components

ML Models: Simulated analysis in JS (can be connected to Python backend for real predictions)


⚙️ How It Works

Text Input – Paste or type a news article.

Model Selection – Choose Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, or Ensemble.

Analysis – Script checks for fake/real indicators and calculates probabilities.

Result Display – Shows FAKE or REAL status with confidence score and recommendation.


🔮 Future Improvements

* Connect with Python Flask/Django backend for real ML predictions

* Use actual datasets like ISOT and LIAR for training

* Improve NLP preprocessing with libraries like NLTK or spaCy

* Add API integration for real-time news source verification
